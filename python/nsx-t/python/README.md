Overview
--------

This repository contains code samples for the NSX-T Python
SDK.

Installation
------------
To install the SDK samples, clone this git repository into a
directory in your file system. You also need to have Python
2.7 or later or Python 3.4 or later.

The easiest way to install the NSX-T python SDK and its dependencies
is to use Python virtualenv. This allows you to install the SDK
and its dependencies without having to alter your system python
libraries, and also doesn't require root privileges.

To set up the NSX-T python SDK using virtualenv, make sure that the
following are installed:

* python2, version 2.7.9 or later, or python3, version 3.4 or later
* virtualenv
* pip

To install the SDK and its dependencies, issue the following commands:

    # 1) install a virtual env into directory "venv"
    virtualenv venv

    # 2) activate the virtual environment
    source venv/bin/activate

    # 3) Copy the NSX-T SDKs and vapi runtime:
    # For NSX-T 2.1, navigate to the VMware{code} website python SDK
    # site at https://code.vmware.com/sdks and follow the
    # VMware NSX-T for Python link.
    # Copy all SDK files to the lib directory in this repo.

    # 4) install the NSX-T SDK, and the vapi runtime
    pip install lib/*.whl

Preparing to run the samples
----------------------------

Be sure you are in the top level of the SDK examples, then add
the current directory to your PYTHONPATH:

    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`

To run the samples, you need to have a working NSX-T manager
installed. To run the NSX policy SDK examples, you will need
to have a working NSX-T Policy appliance running.

Running the samples
-------------------

Each sample takes the following command-line arguments:

     -h,--help                     Get help
     -n,--nsx_host <arg>           NSX host to connect to
     -t,--tcp_port <arg>           TCP port for NSX server (optional, defaults
                                   to 443)
     -u,--user <arg>               User to authenticate as
     -p,--password <arg>           Password

Each sample has a comment block at the top with more information.

As an example, to run the crud.py example on host 10.162.18.202,
authenticating as user "admin" with password "Secret!23":

    python basics/crud.py -n 10.162.18.202 -u admin -p "Secret!23"

Cleaning Up
-----------

When you are finished with the virtual environment, you can
deactivate it by typing:

    deactivate


Troubleshooting
---------------

If you are running on MacOS, the following guides may help you get
python, pip, and virtualenv installed:
