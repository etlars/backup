This example shows basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.
Using one of the simplest NSX resource types, a Transport Zone, we will
show how create, read, update, and delete operations are performed.

Compatible with: NSX-T 2.1

APIs used:

List transport zones:
GET /api/v1/transport-zones

Create a transport zone:
POST /api/v1/transport-zones

Read a transport zone:
POST /api/v1/transport-zones/<zone-id>

Update a transport zone:
PUT /api/v1/transport-zones/<zone-id>

Delete a transport zone:
DELETE /api/v1/transport-zones/<zone-id>

    # submits an update operation, and the revision property in the
    # payload provided by the client does not match the revision
    # stored on the server, another update must have happened since
    # the client last read the resource, and the client's copy is
    # therefore stale.  In this case, the server will return a 412
    # Precondition Failed error. This is intended to prevent clients
    # from clobbering each other's updates. To recover from this
