This example shows how to create a basic domain in the
NSX Policy service.

Compatible with: NSX-T 2.2

APIs used:

List infra domains:
GET /policy/api/v1/infra/domains

Create a new infra domain
POST /policy/api/v1/infra/domains

Read an infra domain:
GET /policy/api/v1/infra/domains/<domain-id>

Update an infra domain:
POST /policy/api/v1/infra/domains/<domain-id>

Delete an infra domain:
