"""
This example shows how to manage tags on NSX-T resources.
Tags are arbitrary metadata that you can set. They can
be used as search criteria for groups, which allows group
membership to be dynamically determined.

In this example, we'll create some logical ports and apply
tags to them. Then we'll create some groups and show how
the group membership changes as new ports are added,
removed, or have their tags changed.

In NSX-T, tags have a scope and a value. The scope allows
you to define different namespaces for whatever purpose
you need. For example, a scope "department" could be
used in indicate which department "owns" a particular
resource.

Groups can be the target of an applied_to in a firewall
section. So, for example, if you want to disable a set of
logical ports (for example, where you suspect some sort
of security breach), you could define a firewall section
that blocks all traffic and apply it to a group whose
members include any ports with the tag "security" and
scope "breach". When you add the "security:breach" tag
to a port, it will become a member of that group and
the block-all firewall policy will become effective.
